# Special Prize Club - Security Awareness Training

A simple security awareness website demonstrating common scam tactics.

## About

This site warns users about "free prize" scams and social engineering tactics used in phishing attempts.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main page with warning message and licensing info
- `qr.html` - QR code page (needs to be created)
- `rickroll.gif` - Image asset (needs to be added)

## Image Quality Note

The `rickroll.gif` file currently has quality issues (grainy/pixelated). To improve:

1. **Find a higher quality source** - Search for a better quality version of the rickroll gif
2. **Use image editing tools** - Tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online services can help:
   - Upscaling tools (waifu2x, Real-ESRGAN)
   - AI enhancement services (Topaz Labs, Let's Enhance)
3. **Replace with alternative** - Consider using a different image entirely

## Deployment

This site can be deployed to Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting service.
